Notes:
 - This project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - I only know some basics of C++, so vet the code before attempting to use/run it! For me, making this project was more about learning how to use AI tools than the actual project itself.
 - This program seems to be working as intended, but has had very limited testing. It is still considered experimental at this stage, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work correctly.
